I used to adhere to standards and open platforms, but today I had an *epiphany*. Stop writing **JavaScript**, you can run **C#** in your browser merely by installing **Silverlight**! A well-loved plugin. Who doesn't love plugins?

Naysayers would argue that **JavaScript** runs everywhere (even on mobile). These are probably the same people trying to convince you that you can be a productive member of society without _REAL_ Office. Nonsense.

After the eventual concession that **C#** will rule the world, those naysayers may come back and mention 'server-side'. They will undoubtedly mention **Node**. Pfft. You will calmly reply, **.NET**.

Checkmate. Send + Mic drop.

Net Neutrality is a confusing concept. It involves technology. This makes it all the more difficult to explain. Because of this, there are oodles of misinformation on the subject. Most opponents of Net Neutrality do not understand what it even is.

One of the simplest ways to understand Net Neutrality is to imagine ISPs as electricity providers. If Internet access was electricity and Net Neutrality was repealed, 'electricity providers' (ISPs) would be able to charge you not only for the electricity you used, but also _how_ you used that electricity. Imagine this electricity advert, wherein electricity is not considered a utility:

Do you see where this is going? Do you want to live in this world? This is exactly what Net Neutrality would allow ISPs to do. Now opponents of regulation will no doubt argue that the free market will fix this. This would be true, if ISPs were not **unregulated legal monopolies**. Since there is little to no competition or choice for an ISP for most consumers, the only way to guarantee an Internet that does not violate the First Amendment, is to classify ISPs as Title II common carriers, in other words, **SUPPORT NET NEUTRALITY**.
